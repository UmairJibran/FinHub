## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (To be done when app is running)
- [ ] Create a new position in a portfolio
- [ ] Add to an existing position (test cost averaging)
- [ ] Edit position quantity (test cost basis recalculation)
- [ ] Delete a position (test confirmation dialog)
- [ ] View position metrics and portfolio summary
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid inputs, network errors)

### Automated Testing (Future enhancement)
- [ ] Unit tests for cost basis calculator
- [ ] Component tests for forms and lists
- [ ] Integration tests for position workflows
- [ ] E2E tests for complete user journeys

## Notes

The position management system is now fully integrated into the portfolio tracker application. All core functionality has been implemented according to the requirements, including:

- Complete CRUD operations for positions
- Sophisticated cost basis calculations
- Comprehensive UI components
- Proper error handling and validation
- Integration with the existing portfolio system

The system is ready for testing and can be extended with additional features like:
- Transaction history viewing
- Position performance charts
- Bulk position operations
- CSV import/export functionality
