### Session Management
- [x] Secure session handling with Supabase Auth

- [x] Activity tracking for session extension
- [x] Automatic session cleanup on expiration
- [x] PKCE flow for OAuth authentication

### Code Cleanup

- [x] No console.log statements found in codebase
- [x] All dependencies are actively used
- [x] Proper TypeScript types throughout

### Security Testing

- [x] Security audit system (`src/lib/security-audit.ts`)
- [x] Automated security tests in development
- [x] Input validation testing
- [x] XSS and SQL injection prevention testing

### Production Security

## Security Audit Results

The application includes an automated security audit system that tests:

1. **Input Validation** - XSS prevention, SQL injection prevention, sanitization
2. **RLS Policies** - Database access controls and data isolation
3. **Environment Security** - HTTPS, CSP, environment variables
4. **Code Cleanup** - Unused code removal, production hardening

Run the security audit in development mode to see detailed results.

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Set `VITE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your production domains
   - Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` uses HTTPS
   - Validate all environment variables before deployment

2. **Monitoring**
   - Implement security event logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
   - Set up alerts for security violations

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Run security audits regularly
   - Update dependencies frequently
   - Review and test RLS policies

4. **Additional Measures**
   - Consider implementing WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Add DDoS protection
   - Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
